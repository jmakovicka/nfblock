Introduction
============

NFblockD is a linux daemon filtering the IP connections according to a
supplied blocklist file. It understands the blocklists in the
following formats:

* IPFilter ascii files (used by eMule & derivatives, available at
  http://bluetack.co.uk). The input file can be optionally compressed
  using gzip.

* PeerGuardian ascii files, optionally gzipped.

* PeerGuardian binary files. Versions 1-3 are currently supported.

NFblockD can load more blocklist files if needed. The IP ranges will
be properly merged in that case.

.Requirements.

1) iptables and kernel support for connection and state tracking (
   ip_conntrack,ipt_state) and ipt_NFQUEUE kernel modules/built-in.

   At least kernel 2.6.14 together with the userspace libraries
   libnfnetlink and libnetfilter_queue are required to use the NFQUEUE
   interface.

   The following modules should suffice to run NFblockD:
	
	nfnetlink_queue         9280  1
	nfnetlink               4824  2 nfnetlink_queue
	ipt_NFQUEUE             1408  2
	ipt_state               1472  0
	ip_conntrack           40044  1 ipt_state
	iptable_filter          2176  1
	ip_tables              17600  3 ipt_NFQUEUE,ipt_state,iptable_filter

2) A valid guarding.p2p/ipfilter.dat/p2p.p2b host file(s).

   If you install the Debian package, the "Normal" IP blocklist from
   http://bluetack.co.uk will be downloaded and used by default. It
   can be changed by editing BLOCKLIST_URL in the configuration in
   /etc/default/nfblockd and running "dpkg-reconfigure nfblockd".

   If the input file or files contain overlapping IP ranges, they will
   be merged automatically.

3) Minimum iptables knowledge, preferably an already working iptables
   setup :)

   NFblockD filter only packets that are NFQUEUEd with iptables. So
   it's up to you to choose what traffic you want to be filtered.  For
   example if you want NFblockD to filter all the new TCP connections
   that are initiated from your box using NFQUEUE kernel interface:

	iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -j NFQUEUE

   NFQUEUE supports multiple queues (using --queue-num option), you
   MUST specify it when launching NFblockD if you don't use the
   default queue 0 using the -q command line option ( -q 0-65535 ).
   Running two or more NFblockD instances to handle different queues
   was not tested, do it at your own risk!

   You might find out that using the blocklists as they come cripples
   your connectivity too much. For example, some of the lists also
   contain the private IP ranges, so it will cut you off completely if
   you are on a LAN. It is also reasonable to punch some holes for the
   "safe" protocols. To do this, you can define two additional chains,
   one for the incoming traffic, and another one for outgoing.

   This allows outgoing trafic to the local LAN, together with FTP,
   http CVS and subversion:

       iptables -N nfqout
       iptables -A nfqout -o $IFACE -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
       iptables -A nfqout -o $IFACE -p tcp -m multiport \
       		--dport ftp,http,https,svn,cvspserver -j ACCEPT
       iptables -A nfqout -o $IFACE -j NFQUEUE

   This allows incoming trafic from the local LAN:

       iptables -N nfqin
       iptables -A nfqin -i $IFACE -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
       iptables -A nfqin -i $IFACE -j NFQUEUE
   

** VERY IMPORTANT WARNING!! **

   When a packet hits a NFQUEUE/QUEUE rule it will be accepted or
   dropped by NFblockD (well it is what you want right? :P) so it will
   NOT be checked by other rules that may follow in the
   chain. Basically, the best practice is having the default DROP
   policy set, and then replacing the ACCEPT targets where you'd like
   to have an additional filtering with either NFQUEUE or
   nfqin/nfqout.

.Installation & Usage.

   To build NFblockD from sources just do

   make

   in the directory where you extracted it. To build a Debian package, run

   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

   as usually.

   To run the daemon, use

   ./nfblockd -d nipfilter.dat.gz

   The daemon can be also controlled by the following signals:

   To obtain stats (written to the syslog) about blocked ranges while
   it's running:

   kill -USR1 <pid>   # dumps the stats to syslog

   To reload the blocklist, you can send the HUP signal:

   kill -HUP <pid>    # reloads blocklist(s) and resets stats

.D-Bus support.

   NFblockD is able to report filter hits via D-Bus interface
   org.netfilter.nfblock . You can check the functionality by running

   dbus-monitor --system

   D-Bus can be eventually disabled using the --no-dbus option.

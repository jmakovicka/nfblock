Description: Download blocklist file now?

 NFblock needs a blocklist file to operate. This file contains a list
 of IP address ranges that are forbidden to connect to your machine.

 If you say "Yes", current blocklists will be downloaded from the
 internet right now as the package is installed. This is recommended.
